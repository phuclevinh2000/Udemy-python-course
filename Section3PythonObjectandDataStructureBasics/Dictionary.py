# use dictionary when you want to call by name, not by index
# example
# use list with []
# use dictionary with {}


my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
print(my_dict['key1'])  # will print value1

# to see all the key: .key()
# to see all the value: .value()
# to see all the items: .items()
